Do the language heading detection as normal.

When you get to a h3 then span with class mw-headline and value "Adjective", CHANGE MODE TO GETCOMP

i with value "comparative", then collect all values and join with space, that's the comparative.

i with value "superlative", do the same.

i with value "adverb", do the same, and stop when end tag is p.

You will also use these to work out the comparativeType.

NOW CHANGE MODE TO GETTRANS

You enter an ol. Gather all values into translations arr until you exit ol.

Now get the ultimate value of the 4th td inside the 3rd tr, that's the pluvirnom.

End.
