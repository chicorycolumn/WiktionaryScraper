NOTES
Always search for any "allohomInfo": False as this needs adding manually.

"Conditional" tense on "braÄ‡" should have 18 strings but has 13. I think the Wiktionary page was missing the "conditional impersonal", but nevertheless the word does have it. If you agree, remove the "conditional" on this lemma object and set the "conditional" to True boolean.
