Here are the verbs with no conditional impersonal but the super boolean conditional has been set to True by the minimiser. But we will never use this to create sentences so is okay for now: [brać,biec,usiąść,móc,stać,schodzić,musieć,wkładać,siąść,stanąć,zejść,iść,pójść]

2021-12-17 22:13 SKIPPED. "future" tense on "schodzić" should have 31 strings but has 20. IT GOT GIVEN PF NOT IMPF BECAUSE OF FOLLOWING TABLE IN PARSER. BUG.
