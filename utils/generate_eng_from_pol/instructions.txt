SANHEDRIN STAGE
After collecting several Polish lobjs files into one batch, we now process them into final forms for adding to BE.

1) Put batch file in "output_saved/batches/" with name in format "nou_batch_01.json".

2) Run "S1_doublecheck_trans_of_pol_lobjs.py"
   - to finalise translations of Polish lobjs
   Creates "nou_batch_01_SAN.json"

3) Now you manually go through the generated file and search for flags. Resolve them.
   - üö©  A flag you added in step 2 with your own notes.
   - üèÅ  Add shorthand tags and topics to this duplicated lobj.
   - ‚õ≥  Add signal word eg "pol-nco-005-nail(bodypart)" vs "pol-nco-006-nail(metal)".
   You are modifying "nou_batch_01_SAN.json"

4) Run "S2_expand_tags_and_renumber.py"
   - to expand any shorthand tags you have added to "nou_batch_01_SAN.json" in step 3
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_SAN.json"

5) Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "SAN" argument.
   - to standardise numbering after lobj duplication in step 2
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_SAN.json"

6) Run "S4_create_eng_lobjs.py"
   - to create English lobjs from the Polish ones
   Creates "nou_batch_01_ENG.json"

7) Run "S5_distinguish_sibling_eng_lobjs.py"
   - to delete any unnecessary siblings in the newly created English lobjs
   - to add signal words to the newly created English lobjs
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_ENG.json"

8) Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "ENG" argument.
   - to standardise numbering after merging and deleting in step 7
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_ENG.json"
