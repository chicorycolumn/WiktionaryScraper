Now that you have collected several Polish lobjs files into one batch.

1) Put batch file in "output_saved/batches/"
   with a name like "adjectives_batch_1_is_groups_01_to_09.json".

2) Run "utils/generate_eng_from_pol/doublecheck_trans_of_pol_lobjs.py"
   to finalise translations of Polish lobjs.
   It creates the new file "adjectives_batch_1_is_groups_01_to_09_doublechecked.json".

3) Run "utils/generate_eng_from_pol/expand_tags.py" to expand any shorthand tags you have added to the new file
   "adjectives_batch_1_is_groups_01_to_09_doublechecked.json" while resolving flags you added.

4) Run "utils/generate_eng_from_pol/renumber_pol_lobjs.py" to standardise numbering after lobj duplication in step 2.

5) Run "utils/generate_eng_from_pol/create_eng_lobjs.py" to create English lobjs from the Polish ones.
