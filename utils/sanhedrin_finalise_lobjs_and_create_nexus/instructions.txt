SANHEDRIN STAGES

After collecting several Source (probably Polish) lobjs files into one batch, we now process them into final forms for adding to BE.
This means creating the corresponding Target (probably English) lobjs.
And then creating the Nexus objects that connect them.

1) Put batch file in "output_saved/batches/" with name in format "nou_batch_01.json".

2) Run "S1_doublecheck_trans_of_src_lobjs.py"
   - to finalise translations of Source lobjs
   Creates "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

3) Now you manually go through the generated file and search for flags. Resolve them.
   - üö©  A flag you added in step 2 with your own notes.
   - üèÅ  Add shorthand tags and topics to this duplicated lobj.
   - ‚õ≥  Add signal word eg "pol-nco-005-nail(bodypart)" vs "pol-nco-006-nail(metal)".
   You are modifying "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

4) Run "S2_expand_tags_and_renumber.py"
   - to expand any shorthand tags you have added to "nou_batch_01_SRC.json" in step 3
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

5) Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "SRC" argument.
   - to standardise numbering after lobj duplication in step 2
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

6) Run "S4_create_tgt_lobjs.py"
   - to create Target lobjs from the Source ones
   Creates "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

7) Run "S5_distinguish_sibling_tgt_lobjs.py"
   - to delete any unnecessary siblings in the newly created Target lobjs
   - to add signal words to the newly created Target lobjs
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

8) Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "TGT" argument.
   - to standardise numbering after merging and deleting in step 7
   Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"
