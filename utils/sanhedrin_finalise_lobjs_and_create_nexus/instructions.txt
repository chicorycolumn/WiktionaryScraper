SANHEDRIN STAGES

After collecting several Source (probably Polish) lobjs files into one batch, we now process them into final forms for adding to BE.
This means creating the corresponding Target (probably English) lobjs.
And then creating the Nexus objects that connect them.

 1) Put batch file in "output_saved/batches/" with name in format "nou_batch_01.json".

2)  Run "S1_doublecheck_trans_of_src_lobjs.py"
    - to finalise translations of Source lobjs
    Creates "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

3)  Now you manually go through the generated file and search for flags. Resolve them.
    - üö©  A flag you added in step 2 with your own notes.
    - üèÅ  Add shorthand tags and topics to this duplicated lobj.
    - ‚õ≥  Add signal word eg "pol-nco-005-nail(bodypart)" vs "pol-nco-006-nail(metal)".
    You are modifying "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

4)  Run "S2_expand_tags_and_renumber.py"
    - to expand any shorthand tags you have added to "nou_batch_01_SRC.json" in step 3
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

5)  Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "SRC" argument.
    - to standardise numbering after lobj duplication in step 2
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

6)  Run "S4_create_tgt_lobjs.py"
    - to create Target lobjs from the Source ones
    Creates "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

7)  Run "S5_distinguish_sibling_tgt_lobjs.py"
    - to delete any unnecessary siblings in the newly created Target lobjs
    - to add signal words to the newly created Target lobjs
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

8)  Run "S3_renumber_lobjs.py" with "TGT" argument
    - to standardise numbering after merging and deleting in step 7
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

9)  Run "S6_add_frequency_and_register_to_src.py"
    - to move "FREQn", ""slang", "insult", "curseword" out of tags and into own key
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"

10) Run "S7_add_frequency_and_register_to_tgt.py"
    - automatically populate frequency and register from SRC onto TGT
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

11) Run "S8_doublecheck_frequency_on_tgt.py" with step=1 arg then step=2.
    - doublecheck the automatically populated frequency on TGT
    Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

11.5)  If you have renumbered the src lobjs at any point since creating the tgt lobjs in step 6)
       run the supplemental stage "X1_renumber_src_lobjs_in_src_and_tgt.py"
       Modifies "nou_batch_01_SRC.json"
       Modifies "nou_batch_01_TGT.json"

12) Run "S9_create_nexus.py".
    - to connect Source and Target lobjs using the translations data from steps 2-8.
    Creates "nou_batch_01_NEX.json"
