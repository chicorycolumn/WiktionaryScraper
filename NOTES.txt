For lemma objects:

Asterisk before translations mean that these are specific collocations and should not be picked up by general matching
of lemmas across languages by the Palette processor. eg "dotrzymaÄ‡" means "to keep" but only in the sense of "to keep a
promise", and so this translation is marked as "*to keep a promise". So Palette processor should ignore asterisked
translations, unless specificLemmaIds is set.

Square brackets after translation of verbs give info about transitive (default so no square brackets), intransitive [i]
and reflexive [r]. These square brackets should be filtered out by Palette processor, so that matching across languages
can take place.

Sometimes for adjectives a comparative is scraped as a whole lobj on its own - ie "starszy". But don't bother keeping
these, they should be scraped and stored within the main lemma "stary".

I put some translations with ">..." for superlatives/comparatives, but I think get rid of these.

We haven't been using the "an" abstract noun tag - go through done nouns and see where add it.
