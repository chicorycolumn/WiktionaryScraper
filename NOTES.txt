For lemma objects:

Asterisk before translations mean that these are specific collocations and should not be picked up by general matching
of lemmas across languages by the Palette processor. eg "dotrzymać" means "to keep" but only in the sense of "to keep a
promise", and so this translation is marked as "*to keep a promise". So Palette processor should ignore asterisked
translations, unless specificLemmaIds is set.

Square brackets after translation of verbs give info about transitive (default so no square brackets), intransitive [i]
and reflexive [r]. These square brackets should be filtered out by Palette processor, so that matching across languages
can take place.

Sometimes the comparative like "lepszy" appears as a separate lobj, but normally the "dobry" lobj already has all that conjugation data, so unnec.

We haven't been using the "an" abstract noun tag - go through done nouns and see where add it.

Go through all noun lobjs, and have question - are they holdable or not - if unset. Set that for all.
Also set size:
"size1": pocketsize - pin to booklet
"size2": largerbutstillpickupable - book to chair (ie holdable)
"size3": cannotpickup - armchair to ship
